# A react exercise:

This is an exercise I gave myself to learn how to use React.

### Main goals were:
  - learn how to use components
  - how to deal with props
  - how the hooks work, especially useState and useEffect
  - discover the asynchronous programming
  - consume an API

To deal with that I found an interesting subject for me: Astronomy.
I chose an API on the solar system to select data on the different body our system contains.

I used this on two ways:

  First, I created a list of the different bodies classed by category with an individual button to show details for each element.

  Second I used canvas to draw a full simulation of the solar system using part of the API data to draw the elements.

As the style was not very important for me in this exercise, I used Bootstrap to go faster.
